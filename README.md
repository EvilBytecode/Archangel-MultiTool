Archangel is a Powershell based project that boldly exploits Discord's API And Other Apis, wearing the badge of "legal" and "TOS-friendly" or we like to say so. It's a tool designed for those who want to venture into Discord's API or Other Apis.

Here are some key aspects of Archangel:

1. **Diverse Module Set:** Archangel features a range of modules, each designed to expand your capabilities within Multiple APIS while maintaining a low profile, or at least trying to.

2. **User Friendly Design:** We've gone out of our way to make Archangel user friendly, because even rebels need an easy to use tool. It's all part of the disguise.

3. **Compliance and Ethics:** While we playfully push the boundaries, we always aim to remain within the limits set by Discord's guidelines, fostering responsible and ethical use. Or at least we pretend to.


Archangel isn't about grandiose claims of being a masterpiece, it's a simple tool designed to provide a secure and discreet gateway into Discord's API, all while "maintaining a facade of legality and TOS friendliness".
